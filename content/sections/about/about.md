I am a Full Stack Developer and graduate of the Flatiron School Software Engineering bootcamp. My journey into tech has been driven by my passion for creating engaging and interactive web applications. I work with JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ruby, and Rails to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

With over 5 years of experience as an audio/mixing engineer, I have worked both as a freelancer and collaboratively with industry engineers. My passion and expertise in music and technology allows me to bring a unique perspective and use my creativity and attention to detail to ensure timely project delivery and produce high quality and innovative results that cater to the artistic vision of clients.

I thrive in a collaborative environment where we contribute ideas and solutions while bouncing off of each other to reach collective goals. I am always eager to learn new skills and stay updated with the latest technologies and posses a mindset of constant improvement in this ever-evolving industry.

Whether it's writing code or audio engineering, my diverse skill set and dedication ensure that I deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.
